Today I Learned...

There is so much out there in the world of development and software engineering it is impossible to learn it all and keep track of everything.
This repo is mostly for me to keep track of things and just jot down my findings and the things I learn.

Don't expect this to be updated daily, as much as I love to learn and how important it is, I do have a life away from my computer, mostly spent running, skiing and golfing.
